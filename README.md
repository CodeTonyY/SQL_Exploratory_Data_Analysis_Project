# SQL_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project
Building a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) script using MySQL, which demonstrates data cleaning, aggregation, and statistical techniques to extract actionable insights. It simulates a real-world data analysis workflow, starting from dataset preparation and moving through data exploration, summary statistics, and actionable insights.

** Project Overview This project involves:

* Importing a dataset into MySQL for analysis
* Cleaning and preparing raw data for exploration
* Writing SQL queries to summarize and aggregate data
* Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies through EDA
* Documenting results and insights for future reference

** Features:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing in SQL
* Aggregation queries using GROUP BY, HAVING, and window functions
* Trend and distribution analysis with SQL
* Step-by-step EDA pipeline fully written in MySQL
* Example dataset for hands-on practice

** Learning Outcomes:

* Gain experience performing EDA directly in SQL
* Learn how to clean, summarize, and interpret datasets with MySQL
* Understand how SQL fits into the data analysis workflow
